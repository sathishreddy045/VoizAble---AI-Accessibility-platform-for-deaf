1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I'm going to re-record the entire course.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Now, this is a full-fledged course and that's why it's so Lenny, but you cannot finish the entire course in 1 day even if it says 12 hours or 13 hours, it will take time.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Now, let's talk about Java.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Now, why Java is so famous?

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Now if you see the programming index, the top 5 programming language, you will always find Java there maybe at the first position, or at the fourth position, you will find Java.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Why Java is so?

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Famous is because Java has multiple feet.
