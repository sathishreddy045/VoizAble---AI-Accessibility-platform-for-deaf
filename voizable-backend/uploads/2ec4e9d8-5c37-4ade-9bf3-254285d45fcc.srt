1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,879
So, this is the first lecture over Python course.

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:04,600
So, you can say Python course.

3
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:08,240
We will see in this video introduction to Python, right?

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:13,759
You can say some features of this language application areas who are using this Python.

5
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:16,480
Why this is so popular nowadays on features?

6
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,640
This kind of theme we will be discussing in this video about Python or Python.

7
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:22,480
I will pronounce it as Python, right?

8
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:27,400
Okay, now see, Python is nowadays the most popular programming language.

9
00:00:27,479 --> 00:00:31,719
But you can say it is the fastest growing programming language nowadays.

10
00:00:31,719 --> 00:00:38,600
It's not like that it is new language because you you know you think that recently it is it has become so popular.

11
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,600
So, it is a new language.

12
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:52,519
No, the concept of Python came into picture in 1989 and even Java was you know the concept of Java came into picture in 1995.

13
00:00:52,519 --> 00:00:55,039
So, it is before Java, right?

14
00:00:55,039 --> 00:01:04,000
But recently in past few years like Python has become so much popular and why so that also we will discuss, right?

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,239
Now, basically in every area Python is being used right now.

16
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:12,879
The main areas are machine learning data science artificial intelligence.

17
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:15,920
See nowadays the data is a big problem.

18
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:21,599
Many companies like you can say your Facebook, YouTube, any shopping websites.

19
00:01:21,679 --> 00:01:25,919
They are having data of billions of users, right?

20
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:29,439
And how they manage that data and one more thing is what?

21
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:40,639
See, I think you have noticed if you suppose nowadays I you know, a search for especially chicken curry kurtas, right?

22
00:01:40,639 --> 00:01:51,359
So, I have I've been looking for these kurtas on two or three websites, shopping websites and whenever I open any other website, you know, for study, that kind of thing.

23
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:55,519
So, those relevant ads they show me, right?

24
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:57,920
Ads of those chicken curry kurtas and all.

25
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,599
So, how they come to know that advertisers like how they come to know?
