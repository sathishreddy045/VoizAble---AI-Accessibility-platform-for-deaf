1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,200
I'm going to re-record the entire course.
Now,

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:06,500
this is a full-fledged course and that's
why

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:09,800
it's so Lenny, but you cannot finish the

4
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:13,100
entire course in 1 day even if it

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,400
says 12 hours or 13 hours, it will

6
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,699
take time. Now, let's talk about Java.
Now,

7
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:23,000
why Java is so famous? Now if you

8
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:26,300
see the programming index, the top 5
programming

9
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,600
language, you will always find Java there
maybe

10
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:32,900
at the first position, or at the fourth

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,200
position, you will find Java. Why Java is

12
00:00:36,299 --> 00:00:39,099
so? Famous is because Java has multiple

13
00:00:39,199 --> 00:00:40,199
feet.
